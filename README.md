## What is CyanDate?
CyanDate is a really simple way to view the date in your Notification Center widgets! It's clean, with a great look and feel that beats other widgets of the type.

## Installation Instructions
You will need a Mac running Xcode 8 in order to sideload the app onto your device. When opening the project, change the bundle identifier to something else and sign with your own personal Apple ID. Then, you will be able to push it onto your own device.

You will also need to go into Settings > Profile > [Your ID] to trust the developer. Otherwise, the app will not open.

CyanDate will show up in your Notification Center. Please enjoy :).

## Why the weird license?
I am not 18 yet, and my parents have disallowed me from open-sourcing things, because they do not want it being commercially released. So, I have chosen a Creative Commons license that restricts the usage to non-commercial only. This remedies any issues that come with the standard MIT license, at the cost that people cannot use it commercially.

Apologies that this is the case, there is not much I can do about it.
