## What is CyanDate?
CyanDate is a really simple way to view the date in your Notification Center widgets! It's clean, with a great look and feel that beats other widgets of the type.

## Installation Instructions
You will need a Mac running Xcode 8 in order to sideload the app onto your device. When opening the project, change the bundle identifier to something else and sign with your own personal Apple ID. Then, you will be able to push it onto your own device.

You will also need to go into Settings > Profile > [Your ID] to trust the developer. Otherwise, the app will not open.

CyanDate will show up in your Notification Center. Please enjoy :).

**Please Note: The "Personal Team" signing will only last seven days. You will need to relaunch CyanDate from Xcode at least once a week, or it will not open past that point. Either that, or sign with a Developer Program account.**
